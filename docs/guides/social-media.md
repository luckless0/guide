# Using Social Media

If you’ve already made the decision to post a bunch of your personal life online, you can attempt to do damage control and clean it up as best you can, but a lot of it is going to remain there forever. This is a personal decision for people to make, but to use social media for anything other than business seems ridiculous. Instead of spending hours everyday wasting your life looking at other people’s photos and lives, you could create something for yourself.

It's important to remember that when every time you use a free product, you are the product.

For example, Facebook collects your location, personal info such as address, religious beliefs, sexual orientation, your financial info, health info, emails, text messages, photos and videos, audio files, calendar events, contacts, app activity, web browsing history. Facebook monitors posts, videos, and even uses your camera and microphone to customize content recommendations. This extensive data collection isn't exclusive to Facebook but extends across various apps, evident in the permissions required on platforms like Google Play. It's crucial to recognize the loss of privacy associated with using social media and exercise caution in sharing personal information due to potential security risks.

If you happen to have already been the victim of a data breach or you’ve tied your real life tightly with your online life, don’t worry. The world isn’t going to end. You can always start to make changes in how you interact online to start mitigating the damage.
