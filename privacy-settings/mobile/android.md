# Android 14
By enabling all of these settings, you are significantly reducing the amount of tracking and data collection these devices perform, but keep in mind that you are not completely eliminating it.

- **_Note:_** _it is possible to use an Android device without ever signing into a Google account for added privacy. This must be done during device setup. You can use [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/) (or another client such as F-Droid Basic) to procure many [open source](/guides/prologue/open-source) apps, and [Aurora Store](https://auroraoss.com) as a proxy for the Play Store for anything else you can't get on F-Droid. Note that with Aurora you will not be able to use Google to process app-related payments such as subscriptions or one-time payments to download the app. In these cases, it should be possible to sign into the Play Store exclusively without signing into Google on the entire device._
- **_Note:_** _Android in particular is capable of a number of powerful, privacy- and security-enhancing strategies that iOS is not, such as the aforementioned "no account required," alternative app stores, sideloading, user profiles, and much more. Some of these are advanced techniques, but not all, though many of them fall outside the scope of this site. For those using or considering an Android device, I strongly encourage you to check out Privacy Guide's [Android page](https://www.privacyguides.org/en/android/) to get an idea of some of the things your phone is capable of._
