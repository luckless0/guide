# Why should I care?

These days, everything you do is monitored in some way. You might think that since this is so obvious, we shouldn't worry about it. Let's not be so sure about that. Most large organizations owe their fortunes to selling your data. That's why it's so important to become independent of these tech giants. Everything they collect is capable of negatively affecting us now or in the future. It's important to fight back. If people lose the ability to defend their privacy, they will lose one of the most important aspects of their lives.

# I have nothing to hide.

Many people think they don't have much to hide. However, they change their minds when they find out how much they have to hide and how much of that information has long since come to light. All the messages you write on Messenger, your full search history, and your private messages with your lover - it's all in other people's hands. They can use it now or in the future. Just imagine what would happen if information about where you were when you weren't at work got into the hands of your boss, He could easily fire you. These situations don't happen now, but they could start in the coming years if we don't deal with the privacy issue and show all these companies that we don't need their services.
